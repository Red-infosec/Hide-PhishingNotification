# Hide-PhishingNotification
Hide-PhishingNotification uses the Outlook client to create a server rule that will "delete" phishing notification emails (emails containing words like "phishing" and "hacked"). This is useful after successfully phishing a target to prevent blue team from being notified of the target getting phished ("did you click on this phishing email?").
